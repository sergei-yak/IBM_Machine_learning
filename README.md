#### Logistic Regression for classification.
what role each input feature has to play in the prediction of the 1 class:

Large positive value of LR Coefficient for a given field indicates that increase in this parameter will lead to better chance of a positive, i.e. 1 class. 
A large negative value indicates the opposite, which means that an increase in this parameter will lead to poorer chance of a positive class. 
A lower absolute value indicates weaker affect of the change in that field on the predicted class.

#### Multi-class classsification
Feature importance using the coefficients from the One vs All logistic regression model.
